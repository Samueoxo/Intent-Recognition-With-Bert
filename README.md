# Intent-Recognition-With-Bert
Recognising  intent (IR) from text is very useful these days. Usually, you get a short text (sentence
or two) and have to classify it into one (or multiple) categories.
. This Project is a pre-trained NLP model that might solve the (technical)
support problem that many business owners have. I mean, BERT is freaky good! It is really easy to
use, too!
# Data
The data contains various user queries categorized into seven intents. The Data is hosted on https://github.com/sonos/nlu-benchmark/tree/master/2017-06-custom-intent-engines.
# Here are out Intents.
• SearchCreativeWork (e.g. Find me the I, Robot television show)
• GetWeather (e.g. Is it windy in Boston, MA right now?)
• BookRestaurant (e.g. I want to book a highly rated restaurant for me and my boyfriend
tomorrow night)
• PlayMusic (e.g. Play the last track from Beyoncé off Spotify)
• AddToPlaylist (e.g. Add Diamonds to my roadtrip playlist)
• RateBook (e.g. Give 6 stars to Of Mice and Men)
